# Unified Developer Agent Dispatch Suite & CLI

`dt` (Delegate Team) is a powerful, zero-dependency, pure Node.js CLI tool that acts as a **Master Orchestrator** for developer agent tasks. It allows you to take any coding task, automatically route it to the optimal backend AI agent, execute it directly in your local workspace, and automatically manage **seamless, multi-backend failover** if any agent fails.

---

## 🎯 The Pain Points & How We Solve Them

Building and executing agentic workflows in production or local environments is highly prone to failures. Here is how `dt` resolves the most frustrating challenges:

| Pain Point | How `dt` Cures It |
|---|---|
| **Fragility & Rate Limits (429s)** <br> Relying on a single AI provider breaks entire developer workflows when quota limits or network outages hit. | **🔄 Automated Failover Ring** <br> `dt` establishes a robust multi-provider ring. If the selected model fails, it sequentially fails over: `vertexcoder` ➡️ `codex` ➡️ `minimax` ➡️ `opencode` ➡️ `gemini` ➡️ `SELF` until success is guaranteed. |
| **Skyrocketing Token Costs** <br> Feeding entire repositories into giant LLMs for minor edits wastes millions of input tokens every run. | **⚡ Lean Token Protocol (LEANBRIEF)** <br> Uses a targeted, compact task contract. The routing engine minimizes file ingestion size, saving up to **80% on prompt tokens** by only context-feeding relevant files. |
| **Complex Environment Setup** <br> Configuring isolated Python virtualenvs, installing deep SDKs, and managing API keys is a major headache. | **🚀 Autopilot Setup Wizard (`dt setup`)** <br> A fully automated onboarding wizard that handles Python virtual environment creation, pip installs, and cloud provider authentication dynamically. |
| **Security & Hardcoded Credentials** <br> Hardcoding sensitive developer emails or Cloud Project IDs in git history leads to major security leaks. | **🔒 100% Dynamic Authentication Fallbacks** <br> Zero hardcoded keys or emails. `dt` queries active local `gcloud` sessions and stores configurations outside the project directory (`~/.config/dt/config.json`). |
| **Limited Out-of-the-Box Skills** <br> Standard terminal-based coding agents are restricted by their client host tools and lack advanced multi-file capabilities. | **🔗 Skill Linker (`dt link-skill`)** <br> Instantly symlinks the orchestrators directly into local Claude Code and Gemini CLI customization paths as global, high-performance capabilities. |

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone & Link Globally
To install `dt` globally on your workstation:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Pixora-dev-ai/delegate-team.git
cd delegate-team

# Link the package globally
npm link
```
Now, the `dt` and `delegate-team` commands are available globally in your terminal!

### 2. Run Autopilot Setup
Execute the interactive setup wizard to automatically build the isolated virtual environment, install Python SDKs, and configure cloud project settings:
```bash
dt setup
```

### 3. Register Global Skills
Link the orchestrators as global capabilities for Claude Code and Gemini CLI:
```bash
dt link-skill
```

---

## 💻 CLI Commands & Usage

### 🔍 Failsafe Health Check
Scan configuration, API key, and credential readiness across all 6 backends:
```bash
dt check
```

### 🎯 Smart Multi-Backend Dispatch
Run a task. The OpenCode Complexity Router automatically selects the best backend, executing with active automated failover:
```bash
dt run "Write a pytest suite in test_auth.py checking JWT login boundaries"
```

### ⚡ Direct Vertex AI Coder (Single File)
Modify or create a single file at warp-speed:
```bash
dt vx direct index.html "Update the hero title to a premium dark gradient design"
```

### 🤖 Interactive Vertex AI Agent (Autonomous Multi-File)
Start a full autonomous loop to write code, install packages, run tests, and self-correct:
```bash
dt vx interactive "Implement a complete Express.js backend with modular JWT authorization"
```

### 🔌 LLM Gateway Proxy
Start a highly optimized local LLM Gateway Proxy server on port `8080` (compatible with Cursor / VS Code / IDE integrations):
```bash
dt serve 8080
```

## 🤖 Copy for Your Coding Agent

If you are using a coding agent (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI) to work in this workspace, copy the block below and paste it directly into its chat window. This instructs the agent to configure and integrate `dt` instantly:

```text
=================== COPY FOR YOUR AGENT ===================
SYSTEM DIRECTIVE: You are an agentic developer assistant. We have integrated the "Delegate Team (dt)" orchestration suite. Please execute the following tasks to align your local environment:
1. Verify the repository is cloned and linked globally. If not, link it:
   run command: npm link
2. Trigger the Autopilot Onboarding Wizard to build python environments and verify cloud dependencies:
   run command: dt setup
3. Automatically register the orchestrators as global capabilities on this workstation:
   run command: dt link-skill
4. Run a system scan to verify all 6 backends are green:
   run command: dt check
5. Guide the user on selecting complex multi-file tasks and orchestrating them via:
   dt run "your-prompt"
===========================================================
```
